The filament catalogs are named "TNG100_filaments_mcpm_[snap]_c[cut].cat", where [snap] is snapshot number and [cut] refers to the persistence cut used to identify filamentary structure in the DisPerSE framework. We use cut=25 for our fiducial filament catalog, but catalogs for other cuts can be made available upon request.

The columns of each file are as follows (Please refer to the DisPerSE manual https://www2.iap.fr/users/sousbie/web/html/indexd41d.html):

ID = ID assigned to a filament

UX, UY, UZ = Comoving coordinates of one end point of a filament (in Mpc), corresponding to a critical point

VX, VY, VZ = Comoving coordinates of the other end point of a filament (in Mpc), corresponding to another critical point

length = Comoving length of the filament, from one endpoint to the other, in Mpc

persistence_U = Persistence, or robustness to shot noise, of critical point of one endpoint

persistence_V = Persistence, or robustness to shot noise, of critical point of the other endpoint
